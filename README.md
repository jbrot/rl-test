# rl-test

I am using this project to test out some Reinforcement Learning training methods.

This project consists of two parts.
The first part is a set of Reinforcement Learning scenarios adapted from OpenAI's [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym).
The second part consists of the actual RL training code.
